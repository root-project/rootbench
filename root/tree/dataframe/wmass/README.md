This is an adaptation of the real-world RDF analysis available at https://github.com/emanca/wproperties-analysis .

We run on a small amount of simulated data kindly shared with us by the analysis authors.

The RDF code is written in Python but it makes use of C++ helper classes, functions and ROOT dictionaries.
